## Talk Details

### Abstract
The presentation will highlight and discuss the research priorities and interests of data science research in terms of need for data, and the nature of the application of law to data science research. The presentation will discuss some of the “pain points” where legal certainty is crucial and suggest approaches to enable data science researchers to proceed with more legal certainty in their work. Even though examples will be drawn from other jurisdictions, the jurisdictional focus is South Africa.
