## Talk Details
### Abstract
One of the advantages brought by Big Data and Machine Learning to the banking industry is the possibility of producing propensity models, capable of estimating how likely a customer is to acquire a given product. These propensities can be used, among other functionalities, to support cross-sell campaigns. One of the main problems associated with these models is to establish a feedback loop from marketing channels. Customers might be reached through multiple channels, and in addition to that, take some time between being reached and taking up the product, which makes it difficult to know which channel works best and if it was indeed that channel which led to the take-up. The current talk will focus on both problems, i.e. the technical aspects of propensity models and the feedback problem, along with some ideas for future work on this space.
