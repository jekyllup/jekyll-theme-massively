## Introducing Masakhane WEB - A Machine Translation Web Platform for African Languages. 

MasakhaneWeb ([http://translate.masakhane.io](http://translate.masakhane.io)) is a  research tool that can showcase the translation models that Masakhane ([https://www.masakhane.io/](https://www.masakhane.io/)) has developed in the last year 

Tool ->  [http://translate.masakhane.io](http://translate.masakhane.io)

This research tool was developed by Catherine Gitau, Salomon Kabongo KABENAMUALU, Abiodun Modupe and myself with affiliations with Data Science for Social Impact, [https://dsfsi.github.io/](https://dsfsi.github.io/), group at University of Pretoria and AMMI at African Institute for Mathematical Sciences Ghana 
We have a nice tool you can use, but there is more. We release the tool itself as open-source. It has a backend with an API and a frontend. These can be improved. The development was funded through Mozilla Open Source Support [https://github.com/dsfsi/masakhane-web](https://github.com/dsfsi/masakhane-web)

Masakhane recently received a Wikimedia Foundation Research award "Participatory Research for Low-resourced Machine Translation: A Case Study in African Languages" - [https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.195/](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.195/)

See the University of Pretoria announcement [News Link](https://www.up.ac.za/faculty-of-engineering-built-environment-it/news/post_2971116-award-for-african-machine-learning-interface-developed-in-collaboration-with-the-university-of-pretorias-computer-scientists?fbclid=IwAR1ISSbqdlyEdbu1whzlI8C1duXedj1JMJ_NhDlKNDZvsaL8hGa9m_F_Zts)

We are honoured to continue to be able to work with the great community of researchers who collaborate together to push #AfricanNLP and push African Languages on the language Map. See the community here [https://www.masakhane.io/community](https://www.masakhane.io/community).
