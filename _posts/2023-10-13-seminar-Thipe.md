## Talk Details

### Abstract
Code-switching (CS) refers to the use of more than one language within a single sentence. Multilingual communities are more likely to use CS through speech than through text. In today's society, text communication is predominant in social media. There is, however, a lack of code-switched text data to model code-switching for languages with limited resources. Despite this challenge, a variety of sources of code-switched data exist, including social media platforms, speech recordings, transcriptions, and news reports. Because borrowed words are prevalent, these sources are insufficient. Furthermore, the data is normally small in terms of sizing. This has led to the generation of synthetic data as a means of compensating for these limitations.
