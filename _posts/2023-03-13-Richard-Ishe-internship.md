## Summary and Introduction to the research


## Why is it important


## Information about the Summer experience program
The research experience program was started within the DSFSi research group in Winter (June-July 2022) to expose students to research through working with DSFSI group members on different research projects. With the Summer edition, we successfully concluded the first year of the program. This blog post goes into the technical details of the research of one of the student teams. We acknowledge the support of NVIDIA (Hardware grant for GPUs), ABSA (through the ABSA UP Data Science Chair funding for remuneration of the students), Tensorflow for funding for research costs. If you would like to support the sustainability of this program and expansion for the future, please get in touch with Prof Vukosi Marivate vukosi.marivate@cs.up.ac.za
