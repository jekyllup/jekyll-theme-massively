## Talk Details
### Abstract
Since the advent of the COVID19 pandemic, individuals of Asian descent have been the subject of stigma and hate speech in both offline and online communities. One of the major venues for encountering such unfair attacks is social networks such as Twitter. In this study, we introduce a dataset of tweets containing sensitive opinions/news relevant to anti-Asian hate speech and stigma. This dataset can be used as a benchmark for further qualitative and quantitative research and analysis around this issue. To showcase the challenges of algorithmic detection of anti-Asian hate speech, we have also developed machine learning models which detect tweets containing COVID-related stigma and hate speech with the best accuracy of 76%, and therefore, can be used for automatic elimination of such behaviour in online communities. We believe this contribution significantly reduces the unfair stigma, hate speech, and discrimination against Asian people during the pandemic, as well as the post-COVID19 times.
