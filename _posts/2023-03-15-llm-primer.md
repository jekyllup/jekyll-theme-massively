## Abstract

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made significant strides over the past decade, and several technologies that have emerged from research in these fields have become integral to our daily lives. While some of these technologies are obvious, others are taken for granted. In this presentation, I will take you on a journey through the fundamentals of NLP to the latest developments in large language models. I will discuss the potential as well as the limitations of current models and raise the question: what about African languages? Despite the progress made in NLP, there is still a significant gap in language support for African languages, which is an area that requires further exploration and innovation.
