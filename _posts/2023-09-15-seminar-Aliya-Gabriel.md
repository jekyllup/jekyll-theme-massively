## Talk Details

### Abstract
In recent years, large language models (e.g., Open AI’s GPT-4, Meta’s LLaMa, Google’s PaLM) have become the dominant approach for building AI systems to generate and analyze language online. However, most of these automated systems that increasingly mediate our interactions online -- such as chatbots, content moderation systems, and search engines -- are primarily designed for and work far more effectively in English than in the world’s other 7,000 languages. Recently, researchers and technology companies have attempted to extend the capabilities of large language models into languages other than English by building what are called multilingual language models. In this talk we will explain how these multilingual language models work and explore their capabilities and limits. We will also talk more broadly about how companies, researchers, and policymakers can lift the bar of language resourcing and work towards building tools that work equitably across languages and speakers.
