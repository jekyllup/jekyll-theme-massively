## Talk Details
### Abstract
The world is a diverse place with thousands of languages and cultural traditions. Africa alone has over 2,000 languages spoken amongst its 1,2 billion people. However, only a few African languages benefit from emerging human language technologies, and the gap continues to grow as new human language technologies are developed. Perhaps it is time to reflect on why it is critical that emerging human language technologies be inclusive of African languages and what we risk losing if we do not change course.
