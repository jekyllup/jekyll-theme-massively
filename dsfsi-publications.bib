TITLE = {Post-Authorship Attribution Using Regularized Deep Neural Network},
JOURNAL = {Applied Sciences},
VOLUME = {12},

ABSTRACT = {Post-authorship attribution is a scientific process of using stylometric features to identify the genuine writer of an online text snippet such as an email, blog, forum post, or chat log. It has useful applications in manifold domains, for instance, in a verification process to proactively detect misogynistic, misandrist, xenophobic, and abusive posts on the internet or social networks. The process assumes that texts can be characterized by sequences of words that agglutinate the functional and content lyrics of a writer. However, defining an appropriate characterization of text to capture the unique writing style of an author is a complex endeavor in the discipline of computational linguistics. Moreover, posts are typically short texts with obfuscating vocabularies that might impact the accuracy of authorship attribution. The vocabularies include idioms, onomatopoeias, homophones, phonemes, synonyms, acronyms, anaphora, and polysemy. The method of the regularized deep neural network (RDNN) is introduced in this paper to circumvent the intrinsic challenges of post-authorship attribution. It is based on a convolutional neural network, bidirectional long short-term memory encoder, and distributed highway network. The neural network was used to extract lexical stylometric features that are fed into the bidirectional encoder to extract a syntactic feature-vector representation. The feature vector was then supplied as input to the distributed high networks for regularization to minimize the network-generalization error. The regularized feature vector was ultimately passed to the bidirectional decoder to learn the writing style of an author. The feature-classification layer consists of a fully connected network and a SoftMax function to make the prediction. The RDNN method was tested against thirteen state-of-the-art methods using four benchmark experimental datasets to validate its performance. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method when compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods on three datasets while producing comparable results on one dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {The Historical Consistent Neural Networks (HCNN) are an extension of the standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): they allow the modeling of highly-interacting dynamical systems across multiple time scales. HCNN do not draw any distinction between inputs and outputs, but model observables embedded in the dynamics of a large state space. In this paper, we propose to improve the predictive power of the (Vanilla) HCNN using three methods: (1) HCNN with Partial Teacher Forcing, (2) HCNN with Sparse State Transition Matrix, and (3) a Long Short Term Memory Formulation of HCNN. We investigated the effect of those long memory improvement methods on three chaotic time-series mathematically generated from the Rabinovich&ndash;Fabrikant, the Rossler System and the Lorenz system. To complement our study, we compared the accuracy of the different HCNN variants with well-known recurrent neural networks methods such as Vanilla RNN and LSTM for the same prediction tasks. Overall, our results show that the Vanilla HCNN is superior to RNN and LSTM. This is even more the case if you include the above long memory extensions (1), (2) and (3). We demonstrate that (1) and (3) are superior for the modeling of our chaotic dynamical systems. We show that for these deterministic systems, the ensembles are narrowed.},

    abstract = {One of the most precise methods to detect prostate cancer is by evaluation of a stained biopsy by a pathologist under a microscope. Regions of the tissue are assessed and graded according to the observed histological pattern. However, this is not only laborious, but also relies on the experience of the pathologist and tends to suffer from the lack of reproducibility of biopsy outcomes across pathologists. As a result, computational approaches are being sought and machine learning has been gaining momentum in the prediction of the Gleason grade group. To date, machine learning literature has addressed this problem by using features from magnetic resonance imaging images, whole slide images, tissue microarrays, gene expression data, and clinical features. However, there is a gap with regards to predicting the Gleason grade group using DNA sequences as the only input source to the machine learning models. In this work, using whole genome sequence data from South African prostate cancer patients, an application of machine learning and biological experiments were combined to understand the challenges that are associated with the prediction of the Gleason grade group. A series of machine learning binary classifiers (XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, LR, RF) were created only relying on DNA sequences input features. All the models were not able to adequately discriminate between the DNA sequences of the studied Gleason grade groups (Gleason grade group 1 and 5). However, the models were further evaluated in the prediction of tumor DNA sequences from matched-normal DNA sequences, given DNA sequences as the only input source. In this new problem, the models performed acceptably better than before with the XGBoost model achieving the highest accuracy of 74 ± 01, F1 score of 79 ± 01, recall of 99 ± 0.0, and precision of 66 ± 0.1.},

    abstract = {The recent advances in Natural Language Processing have only been a boon for well represented languages, negating research in lesser known global languages. This is in part due to the availability of curated data and research resources. One of the current challenges concerning low-resourced languages are clear guidelines on the collection, curation and preparation of datasets for different use-cases. In this work, we take on the task of creating two datasets that are focused on news headlines (i.e short text) for Setswana and Sepedi and the creation of a news topic classification task from these datasets. In this study, we document our work, propose baselines for classification, and investigate an approach on data augmentation better suited to low-resourced languages in order to improve the performance of the classifiers.},
