We have made this page a resource for prospective students who want to join or work with our group. It is split into all students, then specific options for some subset.

## Research Group Themes

* Machine Learning [ML]
* Natural Language Processing [NLP]
* Social Media [SM]
* Society [Soc]
* Web Technologies [WT]

## All prospective students

This covers most people who are interest in doing research based work with the group. We are a multidisciplinary group so you can come from multiple backgrounds/disciplines.

See this [[GUIDE]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-AdUPZmvmq47hHd47yJsGZCTfZAw770WfST0bQIlsQo/edit?usp=sharing) before you contact Vukosi.
